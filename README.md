"# Deep-Learning-Based-Method-for_Patients-Drug-Reviews" 
This code explores the application of deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis of patients’ drug
reviews. The main focus is to evaluate the effectiveness of bidirectional Long-short-term memory (LSTM)
and a hybrid model (bidirectional LSTM-CNN) for sentiment classification based on the entire review
text, medical conditions, and rating scores. It also investigates the impact of using GloVe word
embeddings on the model’s performance by using two data sets
